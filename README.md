# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

## Objective:
In this project, we have developed an HR Analytics Dashboard aimed at helping organizations analyze and improve employee performance while reducing attrition. Leveraging the HR_Analytics.csv dataset, we have undertaken a series of data analysis steps to gain insights into employee demographics, attrition rates, and key factors contributing to employee turnover.

## Dataset Used: 
We utilized the HR_Analytics.csv dataset to perform our analysis.

## Tool Used: 
POWER BI 

## Data Preparation: 
Before creating the HR Analytics Dashboard, we executed the following data preparation steps:
1.	Data Cleaning
2.	Created conditional column name Attrition count
3.	DAX function to create column Attrition Rate

## Analysis and Insights: 
1.	The organization, with a total of 1470 employees, experienced attrition from 237 employees, resulting in a 16.1% attrition rate.
2.	The average age of employees is 37 years. Employees earn an average salary of 6.5k. On average, employees stay with the company for 7 years.
3.	Male employees are observed to leave the company more frequently than female employees.
4.	Employees with educational backgrounds in Life Science exhibit the highest attrition rate at 38%, followed by Medical (27%), Marketing (15%), and Technical Degrees (14%).
5.	Attrition is most prominent in the 26-35 age group, followed by the 18-25 age group.
6.	Low salary (around 5k) is identified as a major factor contributing to high attrition rates.
7.	Employees who have spent 1-2 years in the company are more likely to leave.
8.	Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists are the job roles with the highest attrition rates.
   
## Recommendations:
